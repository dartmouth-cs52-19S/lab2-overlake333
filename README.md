I created a 'buzzfeed' quiz about which motorcycle you are. I implemented JSON parsing, html, css, and Javascript to calculate from five questions, which category the user falls under. I have 5 questions, each with six answers that are radio-boxes, then a model button that will display the result at the end. I read the question data from a JSON file through a JavaScript function.  

What worked: 
- having an organized folder system to access photos
- going through the class powerpoints for syntax and conceptual problems

What didn't: 
- trying to JSON parse the outcomes into a modal (ran out of time to work on it further. Left it hardcoded)
- tried to get snap scrolling to function
